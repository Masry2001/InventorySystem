Project Idea: Inventory Management System
An Inventory Management System helps manage and track products, product batches, damaged products, expired products, sales, purchases, suppliers, and customers.

Features to Include:
Authentication & Authorization:

User login with role-based access (e.g., admin, employee).
Separate functionalities based on roles.
Product Management:

Add, update, delete, and search for products.
Stock levels with alerts for low inventory.
Sales Management:

Record sales transactions.
Issue receipts/invoices (optional for advanced features).
Track daily, weekly, or monthly sales.
Supplier Management:

Maintain a list of suppliers.
View purchase history for each supplier.
Customer Management:

Track customer details and their purchase history.
Purchase Management:

Record new inventory purchases.
Associate purchases with suppliers.
Reports:

Generate reports for sales, inventory, and purchases.
Export reports to Excel or PDF.
Technology & Structure
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Windows Forms (WinForms) for the presentation layer.
Backend: C# (Business and Data Access Layer).
Database: SQL Server with ADO.NET for connectivity.
3-Tier Architecture:
Presentation Layer:

UI built with Windows Forms (use standard controls for simplicity).
Interacts with the business layer through service methods.
Business Layer:

Business logic (e.g., validation, calculations).
Acts as a bridge between the presentation and data layers.
Data Access Layer:

Manages database operations (CRUD functionality).
Contains ADO.NET code for database connectivity.

Why This System?
Market Relevance:

Inventory management systems are widely used in retail, logistics, and manufacturing industries.
Demonstrating the ability to build one shows competence in transactional systems and data management.
Scalability:

The 3-tier architecture makes it easier to later adapt the application for web or mobile platforms.
Manageable Scope:

The features are substantial enough to showcase my skills.
Steps:
Design database schema using SQL Server.
Break the system into smaller modules and implement them iteratively.
Create clean and user-friendly Windows Forms interfaces.
Add comments and documentation to your code for readability.
Optionally, package the application with a lightweight installer for deployment.
